This is a web application that allows users to select their desired meals. 

The app will then provide them the ingredients required together with the specific amount to help users in purchasing the right items during their grocery run.

As an MVP, the application currently allows users to: 
  1. Register or login
  2. Select meals
  3. View ingredients and meal info
  4. Adjust quantity of ingredients according to serving size
